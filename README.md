This is my personal portfolio website. It is a continuous work in progress and subject to change, be revised, updated, edited or reorganized. It's used to showcase past work and experiment with new technologies, frameworks, etc.

Currently using:
- React (v17)
- Next.js (v10)
- Contentful
- Netlify
- @Emotion (v11)

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c0654649-f7ca-4c1a-a250-c82fc6932717/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/focused-euclid-35abd2/deploys)


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn start`

Starts the application in production mode.
The application should be compiled with \`next build\` first.

See the section in Next docs about [deployment](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/wiki/Deployment) for more information.
